<h1>Unit 8: Cryptography and Its Use in Operating Systems</h1>

<h3>WHAT?</h3>
<p>Week 8 was an exploration of cryptography principles and their application in operating systems, including the use of cryptographic libraries.</p>

<h3>SO WHAT?</h3>
<p>The practical application of cryptography in operating systems is a critical aspect of modern security. The ability to use cryptographic libraries effectively can protect sensitive data and ensure system integrity.</p>

<h3>NOW WHAT?</h3>
<p>Cryptography was another area that had immediate practical application through my code implementation in Unit 11. To enhance the security features of my e-commerce application, I used the bcrypt library for hashing and salting of user passwords. This part of the code development was the most frustrating experience as it took considerable amount of my time. I initially tried using the hashlib but was not successful with resolving the code errors. I had to spend significant amount of time until I succeeded with the bcrypt library. As I was reading and researching on cryptography, it came to my attention that many developers often struggle with using cryptographic libraries in their programs. This raises a concern of usability as pointed out in a study by Acar et al (2017).</p>
