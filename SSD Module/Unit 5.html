<h1>Unit 5: An Introduction to Testing</h1>

<h3>WHAT?</h3>
<p>Week 5 introduced the art of testing software, focusing on security. It covered key terms, testing techniques, and industry practices, emphasizing the use of Python tools for automating the testing process.</p>

<h3>SO WHAT?</h3>
<p>The unit highlighted the significance of a comprehensive test plan and familiarized us with industry standards like OWASP and ISO/IEC/IEEE. I found this to be a great opportunity to expand my knowledge on automated testing and the use of linters for source code review. In my code implementation, I was able to conduct Unit Testing, Whitebox Testing, and linting. Understanding different testing techniques and their relevance in various scenarios is crucial for identifying potential security breaches. However, it is also important to point out that the automated tests that I carried out were only as good as the test cases that I wrote. As an example, when running the unit test for secure login and authentication, the output showed ‘ok’. However, my code had still lacked some user validation functions. These types of situations might give a false sense of security if we are to rely on automated testing without adequately addressing the functions to be checked in the testing codes.</p>

<h3>NOW WHAT?</h3>
<p>As someone who regularly manages software development projects, the lessons from this unit have made me eager to look out for testing approaches proposed in the projects that I will be managing in the near future.</p>
