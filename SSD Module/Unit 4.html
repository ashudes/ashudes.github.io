<h1>Unit 4: Exploring Programming Language Concepts</h1>

<h3>What?</h3>
<p>This unit explored the impact of programming concepts such as regular expressions and recursion on system security.</p>

<h3>So What?</h3>
<p>These concepts are powerful tools in a developer's arsenal but can introduce security vulnerabilities if not used carefully.</p>

<h3>Now What?</h3>
<p>This is a topic that has had immediate practical application for the formative assessment under Unit 11. As part of my code implementation for the online shopping application, I made use of the built-in Regular Expression in Python for password and payment card validation. This experience will help me as a stepping stone to expand further on the concept of regular expressions and recursions. However, I am also keen to learn the potential vulnerabilities they might introduce to systems.</p>
