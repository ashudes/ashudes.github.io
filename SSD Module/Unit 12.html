<h1>Unit 12: The Great Tanenbaum-Torvalds Debate Revisited</h1>

<h3>WHAT?</h3>
<p>This was the final unit of the module and much of the focus was on finalizing the remaining formative assessment.  The Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate is something that I would have liked to participate in but did not get enough time for. However, I have had a chance to read several articles about it. The debate is significant as it sheds light on the ongoing discussion about the most effective system designs for security and efficiency in the face of modern cyber threats.</p>

<h3>NOW WHAT?</h3>
<p>I will continue to read on the Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate and use the insights from it to inform my approach to system design, considering the trade-offs between monolithic and microservice architectures.</p>

<p>The Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate</p>
<p>Read Appendix A: the Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate in DiBona &amp; Ockman (1999) then read Fritzsch et al (2019).</p>
<p>The forum has a message that says: “Torvalds has been proven wrong and it only took nearly thirty years. Microservices and microkernels are the future. “</p>
<ul>
<li>On the forum post a message either agreeing or disagreeing with the above and give a justification (ideally with an academic reference) supporting your view.</li>
<li>Outside the forum, discuss your positions in your team and come up with a team stance. This should be shared in Unit 12.</li>
</ul>

<p>I disagree – the debate is not necessarily yet over. The choice between a monolithic kernel and a microkernel (or other types of kernels) often depends on the specific needs and context of the system in question (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6759218">ieeexplore.ieee.org</a>, n.d.).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Monolithic kernels often exhibit higher performance, with faster system call execution. This is because all the operating system services run in the same memory space, reducing the overhead of inter-process communication (Biggs et al., 2018).</li>
<li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> The design of monolithic kernels is simpler to understand and implement, as all components are in a single executable. This can make them easier to maintain and debug (Biggs et al., 2018).</li>
<li><strong>Maturity and Stability:</strong> Many monolithic kernels, like Linux and Unix, have been around for decades, proving their stability and reliability.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it’s important to note that monolithic kernels also have their drawbacks. For instance, if one service fails, it can lead to an entire system failure. Also, adding a new service may require modifying the entire operating system.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I believe the choice between a monolithic kernel and a microkernel still depends on the specific needs. The debate can only be over if both sides come to an agreement that we need both in different circumstances.</p>
