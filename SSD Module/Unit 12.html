<h1>Unit 12: The Great Tanenbaum-Torvalds Debate Revisited</h1>

<h3>WHAT?</h3>
<p>This was the final unit of the module and much of the focus was on finalizing the remaining formative assessment.  The Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate is something that I would have liked to participate in but did not get enough time for. However, I have had a chance to read several articles about it. The debate is significant as it sheds light on the ongoing discussion about the most effective system designs for security and efficiency in the face of modern cyber threats.</p>

<h3>NOW WHAT?</h3>
<p>I will continue to read on the Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate and use the insights from it to inform my approach to system design, considering the trade-offs between monolithic and microservice architectures.</p>
