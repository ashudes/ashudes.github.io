<h1>Unit 1</h1>

<h3>What?</h3>
<p>The first unit introduced the contrasting management approaches to software development, highlighting the shift from traditional waterfall methods to agile methodologies. The focus was on the importance of secure software development and the introduction of the Unified Modelling Language (UML) for designing software.</p>

<h3>So What?</h3>
<p>The transition from waterfall to agile reflects the industry's move towards more flexible and responsive development cycles, which can better accommodate the need for security. However, the flexibility of agile method should compromise on the security aspects.</p>

<h3>Now What?</h3>
<p>This takes me to a software development project that I was managing. Due to a strict deadline with the utilization of funding for the project, we decided to use an agile development method and the focus was mostly on meeting the deadline with a minimum viable product (MVP). Security aspect was probably not given adequate priority. Striking a balance between a speedy development and integrating thorough security features is something that I look forward to applying in future similar projects.</p>

            <p>In this code, colour is an unprotected variable, and _registration_number is a protected variable. The same applies to the methods get_color and _get_registration_number. Even though _registration_number and _get_registration_number can be accessed, the underscore prefix is a hint to the programmer that they should not be accessed directly. </p>
