<h1>Unit 7: Introduction to Operating Systems</h1>

<h3>WHAT?</h3>
<p>Unit 7 delved into operating systems (OS) and their relationship with programming languages and security, discussing OS functions, common systems, and the distinction between processes, threads, and schedulers.</p>

<h3>SO WHAT?</h3>
<p>The unit emphasized the importance of securing operating systems and provided insights into mitigating OS vulnerabilities. Understanding the differences between static and dynamic libraries is essential for secure system design.</p>

<h3>NOW WHAT?</h3>
<p>While I cannot say that I have grasped enough about OS and security, the unit has raised my interest to read and learn more on this topic.</p>

    <h1>What is an Ontology?</h1>
    <p>Ontology is a structured representation of knowledge about a specific domain. It provides a common vocabulary that describes the types of objects and concepts that exist, and their properties and relationships. Ontology is the core for organizing a modern ecommerce application (Earley, 2024).</p>
    <p>Ontologies can help manage the complexity of system architectures by providing a structured and organized approach to describing and modelling the architecture. They can help identify the relationships among architectural components, the network, and the physical process, as the system characteristics and properties are related (Knöös Franzén et al., 2019).</p>
    <p>In ontology, there are three fundamental components: class, instance, and property. A class represents a concept or category within a domain. An instance is a specific realization or member of a class. A property describes the relationships between instances or between classes and instances. It’s important to note that in ontology, properties can represent not only attributes (features of a concept), but also various types of relationships between concepts. Therefore, while a class can indeed be described by properties that represent its features, properties in an ontology can also represent other types of relationships (Sianturi, 2019; Ding et al., 2004).</p>
    <h2>Here is an ontology that is relevant to the online shopping system that I developed for summative assessment:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Classes: User, Administrator, Product, ProductList, ShoppingCart, Order, Payment, Shipping, CLI (Command Line Interface), DataFile.</li>
        <li>Data Properties: These are attributes of the classes. For example, a User has a name, email, password, payment_details, and shipping_address. A Product has a name and price. A DataFile has a filename.</li>
        <li>Object Properties: These are relationships between different classes. For example, an Administrator can add a Product to a ProductList (add_product relationship). A ShoppingCart belongs to a User (belongs_to relationship). An Order is associated with a ShoppingCart (associated_with relationship). A CLI is associated with a User (user_interface relationship). A DataFile is associated with a ProductList (contains_products relationship).</li>
        <li>Functions/Methods: These could be considered as actions in the ontology. For example, the User class has methods like hash_password and check_password. The Administrator class has methods like add_product and remove_product. The CLI class has methods like register, login, view_product_list, confirm_selection, after_selection, send_to_cart, and remove_product.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This ontology provides a structured representation of the main entities in my online shopping system, their properties, and the relationships between them. It can help in understanding the system, designing new features, and communicating about the system with others.</p>
