<h1>Unit 6: Using Linters to Support Python Testing</h1>

<h3>WHAT?</h3>
<p>Week 6 focused on using linters to develop high-quality Python code, underlining the assumption that high-quality code is secure.</p>

<h3>SO WHAT?</h3>
<p>In the e-Portfolio activity under this Unit, I had a chance to experiment with pylint and flake 8. Unfortunately, I could not run mccabe due to installation issues that I could not figure out. All these tools are useful for code development and testing because they help catch errors and maintain a high standard of code quality. They can catch issues that might be missed during manual code review; and they can enforce a consistent coding style across a project. This can make your code easier to read, understand, and maintain. This understanding is vital for maintaining consistency and error-free code, which are pillars of secure software.</p>

<h3>NOW WHAT?</h3>
<p>Linters are quite useful for analysing codes, bugs, and style errors. From my experience and some reading, it appears that cannot be relied upon for ensuring code security and functionality. Nonetheless, the use of linters is something I will continue to apply in my future coding projects.</p>

    <h4>Unit 6 Seminar: Exploring Linters to Support Testing in Python</h4>
    
</head>
<body>
    <p>The following questions will be discussed during this week’s seminar. These questions are provided in the 'testing-with-python' zip file with instructions provided in the 'Secure Software Development' PDF file. These activities should be completed on your chosen Jupyter Notebook workspace.</p>
    <h2>Question 1: Run styleLint.py</h2>
    <p>What happens when the code is run? Can you modify this code for a more favourable outcome? What amendments have you made to the code?</p>

    <h3>Answers:</h3>
    <p>Indentation error is reported, and I modified code – changed the indentation.</p>

    <h2>Question 2</h2>
    <p>pip install pylint</p>
    <p>Run pylint on pylintTest.py</p>
    <p>Review each of the code errors returned. Can you correct each of the errors identified by pylint?</p>
    <p>Before correcting the code errors, save the pylintTest.py file with a new name (it will be needed again in the next question).</p>

    <h3>Answers:</h3>
    <p>I corrected the following errors: 1) included parentheses in the print function; 2) changed raw_input to input (a recognized syntax in the version of Python that I am using).</p>

    <h2>Question 3:</h2>
    <p>pip install flake8</p>
    <p>Run flake8 on pylintTest.py</p>
    <p>Review the errors returned. In what way does this error message differ from the error message returned by pylint?</p>
    <p>Run flake8 on metricTest.py. Can you correct each of the errors returned by flake8? What amendments have you made to the code?</p>
    <h3>Answers:</h3>
    <p>Both errors from pylint and flake8 are pointing the lack of parenthesis on code line 26 containing ‘print encoded’.</p>
