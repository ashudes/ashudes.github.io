<h1>Unit 6: Using Linters to Support Python Testing</h1>

<h3>WHAT?</h3>
<p>Week 6 focused on using linters to develop high-quality Python code, underlining the assumption that high-quality code is secure.</p>

<h3>SO WHAT?</h3>
<p>In the e-Portfolio activity under this Unit, I had a chance to experiment with pylint and flake 8. Unfortunately, I could not run mccabe due to installation issues that I could not figure out. All these tools are useful for code development and testing because they help catch errors and maintain a high standard of code quality. They can catch issues that might be missed during manual code review; and they can enforce a consistent coding style across a project. This can make your code easier to read, understand, and maintain. This understanding is vital for maintaining consistency and error-free code, which are pillars of secure software.</p>

<h3>NOW WHAT?</h3>
<p>Linters are quite useful for analysing codes, bugs, and style errors. From my experience and some reading, it appears that cannot be relied upon for ensuring code security and functionality. Nonetheless, the use of linters is something I will continue to apply in my future coding projects.</p>

            <p><strong><span>What is an Ontology?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Ontology ** a structured representation of knowledge about a ******** domain. It ******** a ****** vocabulary that ********* the types of objects and concepts that exist, and their properties and relationships. Ontology is the core *** organizing a modern ecommerce application (Earley, 2024).</span></p>
<p><span>Ontologies can **** ****** the ********** of system architectures by providing a structured *** organized approach ** describing and modelling the architecture. **** can help ******** the relationships among ************* components, the network, and the physical process, as the system *************** and ********** *** related <span>(Kn&ouml;&ouml;s Franz&eacute;n et al., 2019)</span>.</span></p>
<p><span>** ontology, there are three fundamental components: class, instance, and property. A ***** ********** a concept ** ******** ****** a domain. An ******** is a specific realization or member of a class. A property ********* *** ************* between ********* or between classes and instances. It&rsquo;s important ** note **** ** ontology, ********** can ********* not only attributes (features ** a concept), but **** various types of relationships ******* concepts. Therefore, while a class can indeed be ********* ** properties that represent its features, properties ** an ontology *** also represent other types ** ************* (Sianturi, 2019; Ding et al., 2004).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>**** is ** ******** that is relevant to the online shopping ****** that I developed for summative assessment:</span></p>
<ol>
    <li><strong><span>Classes</span></strong><span>: User, Administrator, Product, ProductList, ShoppingCart, Order, Payment, Shipping, CLI (Command Line Interface), DataFile.</span></li>
    <li><strong><span>Data Properties</span></strong><span>: These are attributes of the classes. *** example, a **** has a name, email, password, payment_details, and shipping_address. A ******* has a name and price. A ******** has a filename.</span></li>
    <li><strong><span>Object Properties</span></strong><span>: These are relationships between different classes. For example, ** Administrator *** *** a Product ** a ProductList (add_product relationship). A ************ belongs ** a User (belongs_** relationship). An ***** is ********** with a ************ (associated_with relationship). A CLI ** associated **** a User (user_interface relationship). A DataFile ** associated **** a *********** (contains_products relationship).</span></li>
    <li><strong><span>Functions/Methods</span></strong><span>: These could ** considered as actions ** the ontology. For example, the User class *** methods like&nbsp;</span><code><span>hash_password</span></code><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><code><span>check_password</span></code><span>. *** Administrator class has ******* like&nbsp;</span><code><span>add_product</span></code><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><code><span>remove_product</span></code><span>. *** *** ***** has ******* like&nbsp;</span><code><span>register</span></code><span>,&nbsp;</span><code><span>login</span></code><span>,&nbsp;</span><code><span>view_product_list</span></code><span>,&nbsp;</span><code><span>confirm_selection</span></code><span>,&nbsp;</span><code><span>after_selection</span></code><span>,&nbsp;</span><code><span>send_to_cart</span></code><span>, and&nbsp;</span><code><span>remove_product</span></code><span>.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>**** ontology ******** a structured ************** of the main entities ** ** online shopping system, their properties, and the relationships between them. It can **** in understanding *** system, designing new features, *** communicating about the system **** others.</span></p>
