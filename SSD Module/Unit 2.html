<h1>Unit 2: UML Modelling to Support Secure System Planning</h1>

<h3>What?</h3>
<p>Week 2 focused on the practical application of UML in creating flow charts, which are essential during the design stage of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).</p>

<h3>So What?</h3>
<p>Having managed several software development projects in my career prior to joining this course, UML is one of the concepts that I have applied without having adequate understanding of the concept. The ability to create detailed flow charts is a valuable skill, as it aids in visualizing and communicating the steps of a process, which is particularly important when considering security implications.</p>

<h3>Now What?</h3>
<p>The knowledge I have gained from this unit and the previous Module on OOP (which also covered UML) equips me with readiness to communicate and understand the requirements, use cases, structures, and functions of a software much better. I will also look out for literatures discussing the capability of UML in representing security concerns within a system.</p>

            <p<h1>Managing People to Overcome Internal Cyber Security Threats</h1>
<p>It is often said that the biggest risk comes not from sophisticated hackers or advanced malware, but from the people within the organisation (Young, 2017). The ISO/IEC Standard 27000 provides a comprehensive set of terms and definitions that can help us understand and manage this risk. In this post, I will focus on five key terms: Access Control, Information Security Management System (ISMS), Risk Assessment, Risk Treatment, and Asset.</p>

<h2>Access Control</h2>
<p>Access Control is the first line of defence against internal threats. It ensures that only authorized individuals have access to the organisation’s information systems. This involves implementing strong password policies, two-factor authentication, and least privilege principles. Regular audits of access controls can identify potential vulnerabilities, such as excessive permissions or inactive accounts (ISO/IEC 27000, 2018, Cao et al., 2019).</p>

<h2>Information Security Management System (ISMS)</h2>
<p>An Information Security Management System (ISMS) is a systematic approach to managing sensitive company information so that it remains secure. It includes people, processes, and IT systems. An effective ISMS can help an organisation assess and treat information security risks. It also promotes a security-conscious culture within the organisation (ISO/IEC 27000, 2018).</p>

<h2>Risk Assessment</h2>
<p>Risk Assessment is a critical component of an ISMS. It involves identifying and evaluating the risks to the organisation’s information. This includes risks posed by people within the organisation. Regular risk assessments can help the organisation identify potential insider threats, such as employees with access to sensitive information who may be disgruntled or susceptible to social engineering attacks. Once risks have been assessed, they must be treated (Ji, 2021; ISO/IEC 27000, 2018).</p>

<h2>Risk Treatment</h2>
<p>Risk Treatment involves selecting and implementing measures to modify risk. In the context of people-related risks, this could involve providing security awareness training, implementing a strict policy for handling sensitive information, or improving the vetting process for new hires (Ji, 2021; ISO/IEC 27000, 2018).</p>

<h2>Information Security Incident</h2>
<p>Finally, an Information Security Incident refers to an event that has a negative impact on the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of an organization’s information. This could be caused by a person within the organization, whether intentionally or unintentionally (Hove et al., 2014). By understanding and responding effectively to such incidents, organizations can minimize their impact and prevent future occurrences.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, managing people to overcome internal cyber security threats involves a combination of technical controls, processes, and a security-conscious culture. By understanding and applying key concepts from the ISO/IEC Standard 27000, organisations can better protect themselves against the often-overlooked risk of insider threats.</p>
