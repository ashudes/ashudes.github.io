           <h1>Unit 12: Working with Design Patterns to Structure Code</h1>

<p>In Unit 12 we examined the application of design patterns to structure code.</p>

<h2>Expected outcome:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Examine the factory design pattern and consider how it may be implemented in software.</li>
    <li>Consider the fact that multiple design patterns may be applied alongside one another in a single code development.</li>
    <li>Recognise that some design patterns are more likely to be used with others in a single code development.</li>
</ul>

<h2>On completion of this unit we are expected to be able to:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Write a Python program which applies a factory design pattern to generate objects.</li>
    <li>Discuss the fact that multiple design patterns are able to be applied together to support a single code development.</li>
    <li>Describe the design patterns which are more likely to be applied with one another in a single code package.</li>
</ul>

<p>The content this week will support students in understanding how code may be structured from an architectural perspective using design patterns. This will inform on the relationships between different modules of the system, allowing their shaping depending on interactive behaviour. Student attention will be brought to the fact that more than one design pattern may be applied within a single code development, with attention also being given to the fact that some design patterns fit together more easily and realistically than others.</p>        </details>

            <p>In this code, colour is an unprotected variable, and _registration_number is a protected variable. The same applies to the methods get_color and _get_registration_number. Even though _registration_number and _get_registration_number can be accessed, the underscore prefix is a hint to the programmer that they should not be accessed directly. </p>
