            <p>The introduction to Python programming and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) has been an eye-opener for me, especially considering that my background is in a non-computer science field. I've realized how OOP has fundamentally changed my approach to coding.</p>

            <p>In this unit, I learned the basics of object-oriented programming, its major features, abstract classes, applying inheritance, using encapsulation, and polymorphism. Initially, the concept of classes and objects was a bit abstract and challenging to grasp. To augment my understanding, I had to take additional Python courses online. As I delved deeper into the subject, I began to understand the power and flexibility that OOP offers.</p>

            <p>One of the first concepts I learned was the idea of a 'class' - a blueprint for creating objects. I found it fascinating how classes allowed for encapsulation, where data and methods could be bundled together. This not only made the code more organized but also enhanced its reusability. Since I was using a lot of online resources, the interchangeable use of terms such as properties, attributes, and fields was initially confusing. Similarly, methods, functions, and operations were interchangeably used in my readings. I managed to get more clarity through further readings.</p>

            <p>Inheritance was another concept that stood out to me in OOP. The ability to create a new class, a 'child', from an existing 'parent' class, while inheriting its attributes and methods, was a game-changer. It allowed for code to be reused and extended, reducing redundancy.</p>

            <p>Overall, learning Python's OOP has been a transformative experience. It has not only equipped me with a powerful tool for problem-solving but also changed how I think about code organization and reusability. As I continue my coding journey, I look forward to exploring more advanced OOP concepts and applying them in my projects.</p>

            <p>In this code, colour is an unprotected variable, and _registration_number is a protected variable. The same applies to the methods get_color and _get_registration_number. Even though _registration_number and _get_registration_number can be accessed, the underscore prefix is a hint to the programmer that they should not be accessed directly. </p>
