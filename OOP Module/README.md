Reflections on my journey of learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

The introduction to Python programming and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) has been an eye-opener for me, especially considering that my background is in a non-computer science field. I have realized how OOP has fundamentally changed my approach to coding.
In Unit 1, I learned the basics of object-oriented programming, its major features, abstract classes, applying inheritance, using encapsulation, and polymorphism. Initially, the concept of classes and objects was a bit abstract and challenging to grasp. As I delved deeper into the subject, I began to understand the power and flexibility that OOP offers.

Unit 2
Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA) is typically conducted in an iterative and incremental way. The outputs of OOA activities are analysis models. The intention is for these to be continuously refined and evolved, driven by key factors like risks and business value.

Unit 3
During the 3rd week, we covered Unified Modelling Language (UML). I did not find UML to be an entirely new concept, despite my background being in a non-computer science field. I actually used UML several times before without knowing much about the required standardization and how one is different from another type. I managed several software development projects recently where I prepared and used ‘use-case diagrams’ and ‘activity diagrams’ as part of the scope of work for the software developers. In my understanding back then, these ‘diagrams’ were just a creative way of explaining my desired software to the developer. In a way – I thought that the ‘diagrams’ are very much subjective and there are no rules and standards to follow which is quite the opposite of what I learnt in Unit 3. However, the key lesson here is – there is a rule and standard to the use of UML.

Unit 4
In Unit 4, I had a chance to explore further on the differences of each UML types. With continuous practice, I learnt more about the differences of each UML type and how they are used at the different stages of SDLC. While referring to online literature one thing that caught my attention is the variations of each UML type. For example, you would notice how one author applies use case diagram much differently from another. In some cases, some big variations had me ask – where is the standardization?

Unit 5 
I continued practicing more on UML while also brainstorming on the summative assessment for designing UML for a python OOP proposal for driverless car. I conducted online literature search around the same topic. I must say – there is a lot to learn about the domain of driverless car than UML and OOP itself.

Unit 6
As someone who has always wondered and got so curious as to how software programmers manage to break highly complex functions into codes, the lessons in Unit 5 and 6 provided some answers. Polymorphism stood out for me as a fundamental concept in OOP that allows for greater efficiency, flexibility, and simplicity in code. Together with the other pillars of OOP, this, I understand, is one of the reasons why programmers can handle very complex programs with relative ease.

Unit 7 & 8
In week 7, I spent much time preparing for the summative assessment - a design proposal of software to support the operation of a driverless car. As I indicated above, the assignment requires a lot of reading to understand the technical domain of a driverless car because of the complexity of the technology.
Debugging or error handling is not a new concept at all for me with a little coding experience that I had in the past. However, learning how Python handles errors did add a lot to my understanding of the concept. A key concept that I learned about error handling in Python is how it is done through the use of exceptions that are caught in try blocks and handled in except blocks (Beckles & Dowling, 2012).

Unit 9 & 10
Packaging and testing provided an essential insight on how I could package and test my Python OOP code for the upcoming assignment. Eventually, I decided to package my codes into three modules according to my three selected functions to support a driverless car.
Based on the insights from these units, I applied automated unit testing, functional testing, and structural testing in my Python codes for the summative assessment. Below is a screenshot of the unit testing that I applied in my implementation of the driverless car software using the in-built unittest module of Python.
  

Unit 11 & 12
In these units, I dedicated much of my time to finalizing the submission for summative assessment. As I described earlier, understanding the technology domain of a driverless car on its own requires quite a lot of time, let alone application of the concept using Python (especially for a beginner like me). Besides, almost all of the online literature sources make references to various libraries that are used with Python for developing a driverless car software. Some of these libraries are OpenCV, TensorFlow, TensorFlow hub, numpy, matplotlib, Carla, L5kit, YOLO5/3, and PythonRobotics. I could not ignore the libraries because they seemed to be essential to executing the code. For example, graying the picture colour, applying the Gaussian Blur and Hough-Lines required CV2.

Nonetheless, I still faced several frustrations during the coding and testing process of my project; mainly errors in codio while installing and importing the libraries. Despite the challenges, I am quite happy with what I have learnt and the experience I gained throughout the coding process.
Overall, learning OOP has been a transformative experience. It has not only equipped me with a powerful tool for problem-solving but also changed how I think about code organization and reusability. As I continue my coding journey, I look forward to exploring more advanced OOP concepts and applying them in my future projects.
