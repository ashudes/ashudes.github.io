            <summary><h1>Unit 4: Applying a UML Model to a Program Implementation: UML in Practice</h1></summary>
            <p>Unit 4 focuses on the practical application of UML models in programming. The unit involves experimenting with various UML models, including class diagrams, and implementing these models in Python.</p>
            
            <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
            <p>By the end of the unit, students will be able to create a class diagram for a system and implement software based on a UML model.</p>
            
            <h2>Relevance</h2>
            <p>The skills learned in this unit will be crucial for the summative assessment in Week 11, where students will code from the design documents submitted in Week 7.</p>

            <h1>Key lessons from Unit 4</h1>
            <p>In Unit 4, I had a chance to explore further on the differences of each UML types. I used Draw.io application for the drawings. With continuous practice, I learnt more about the differences of each UML type and how they are used at the different stages of SDLC. While referring to online literature one thing that caught my attention is the variations of each UML type. For example, you would notice how one author applies use case diagram much differently from another. In some cases, some big variations had me ask â€“ where is the standardization?</p>

            <p>In this code, colour is an unprotected variable, and _registration_number is a protected variable. The same applies to the methods get_color and _get_registration_number. Even though _registration_number and _get_registration_number can be accessed, the underscore prefix is a hint to the programmer that they should not be accessed directly. </p>
