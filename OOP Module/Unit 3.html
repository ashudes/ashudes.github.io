           <h1>Unit 3: UML</h1>
            <p>This unit introduces the Unified Modelling Language (UML), a standardised toolset for representing software systems on paper before coding them.</p>

            <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
            <p>By the end of this unit, you will be able to recognise the syntax of UML models, distinguish between different UML models for different stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), and develop UML models using open source tools.</p>

            <h2>Relevance</h2>
            <p>The UML content in this unit is important for designing the software system that you will submit in Week 6 using Python.</p>

            <h3>Key lessons from Unit 3 (Week 3)</h3>
            <p>During the 3rd week, we covered Unified Modelling Language (UML). I did not find UML to be an entirely new concept, despite my background being in non-computer science field. I actually used UML several times before without knowing much about the required standardization and how one is different from another type. I managed several software development project recently where I prepared and used ‘use-case diagrams’ and ‘activity diagrams’ as part of the scope of work for the software developers. In my understanding back then, these ‘diagrams’ are just a creative way of explaining your desired software to the developer. In a way – I thought that the ‘diagrams’ are very much subjective and there are no rules and standards to follow which is quite the opposite of what I learnt in Unit 3.</p>

            <p>UML is a standardized modeling language used in object-oriented programming (OOP)[^1^][1]. It provides an integrated set of diagrams to help system and software developers specify, visualize, construct, and document the artifacts of software systems. UML is not a programming language itself, but rather a visual language used to represent the design of a system.</p>

            <h4>UML diagrams</h4>
            <p>UML diagrams can be broadly classified into three main groups:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Behavior diagrams: These diagrams represent the dynamic behavior of the objects in a system, which can include their methods, interactions, and activities.</li>
            <li>Interaction diagrams: These diagrams depict the interactions between objects and the order in which these interactions occur.</li>
            <li>Structure diagrams: These diagrams show the static structure of the system using objects, attributes, operations, and relationships.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>UML is widely used in the software development process and is an important part of developing object-oriented software.</p>

            <summary><h2>e-Portfolio Activity</h2></summary>
 <p>Different types of UML diagrams are used at different stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Here’s a brief overview:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Use Case Diagrams: Used during the requirements gathering and high-level design phase to identify common sets of activities that users of the system indulge in. They help in understanding the functional requirements of the system.</li>
            <li>Class Diagrams: Used as early as the high-level design process to define the domain model for the application, specifically, the relationship of data objects within the system, the relationships between them, and the operations that they can perform.</li>
            <li>Sequence Diagrams/Communication Diagrams: Known collectively as interaction diagrams, they are used during the high- and low-level design process to show the interactions between objects in the system. They are also very helpful in the testing state when creating testing processes and procedures.</li>
            <li>Activity Diagrams: Used during requirements gathering and high-level design to further identify process flows within the system.</li>
            <li>Object Diagrams: These provide a snapshot of a system at an instance in time and are used to model complex structures.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The choice and use of these diagrams can vary depending on the specific needs of the project and the development methodology being used.</p>
