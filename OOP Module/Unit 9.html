<h2>Summary:</h2>
<summary><h1>Unit 9: Packaging and Testing </h1></summary>
<p>This Unit focuses on the packaging and testing of Python programs. It is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of how to prepare a Python program for distribution and how to ensure its quality through testing.</p>

<h2>Learning Outcomes:</h2>
<p>Upon completion of this unit, students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Understand and apply the concept of packaging a Python program.</li>
    <li>Use the PEP257 convention to effectively document their Python code.</li>
    <li>Understand and describe various approaches used to test code.</li>
    <li>Use Python’s tools to test the quality of their code.</li>
</ul>
<p>The knowledge and skills gained from this unit will be particularly useful in finalizing the code developed for the summative assessment, ensuring its quality and readiness for distribution. This unit represents one of the final steps in the Python development process, emphasizing the importance of code quality and documentation.</p>

<h2>Key lessons from Unit 9</h2>
<p>Unit 9 was about packaging and testing – which provided an essential insight on how I could package and test my python OOP code for the upcoming submission for summative assessment. Eventually, I decided to package my codes into three modules according to my three selected functions to support a driverless car.</p>
