            <summary><h1>Unit 1: An Introduction to Python Programming and the OO Programming Paradigm</h1></summary>
            <p>In this introduction to Python programming, we gained an understanding of the evolution of programming languages towards object orientation, and beyond it in response to the challenges of programming in an object oriented way.</p>
            <h2>In this unit we covered:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Examining what it means for a program to be object oriented.</li>
                <li>Exploring the syntax used to define a Python class.</li>
                <li>Investigating how to define different data types in Python.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Expected outcome from the unit:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Describe the major features of an object oriented program, in the sense of having abstract classes, applying inheritance, using encapsulation, and including polymorphism.</li>
                <li>Define a Python class.</li>
                <li>Define a variety of data types to variables in a Python program and adapt the access modifier applied to each.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This unit will give exposure to the fundamental building blocks of a Python program, upon which advanced features of the programming language will be built in later weeks.</p>

            <summary><h2>Reflections</h2></summary>
            <p>The introduction to Python programming and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) has been an eye-opener for me, especially considering that my background is in a non-computer science field. I've realized how OOP has fundamentally changed my approach to coding.</p>

            <p>In this unit, I learned the basics of object-oriented programming, its major features, abstract classes, applying inheritance, using encapsulation, and polymorphism. Initially, the concept of classes and objects was a bit abstract and challenging to grasp. To augment my understanding, I had to take additional Python courses online. As I delved deeper into the subject, I began to understand the power and flexibility that OOP offers.</p>

            <p>One of the first concepts I learned was the idea of a 'class' - a blueprint for creating objects. I found it fascinating how classes allowed for encapsulation, where data and methods could be bundled together. This not only made the code more organized but also enhanced its reusability. Since I was using a lot of online resources, the interchangeable use of terms such as properties, attributes, and fields was initially confusing. Similarly, methods, functions, and operations were interchangeably used in my readings. I managed to get more clarity through further readings.</p>

            <p>Inheritance was another concept that stood out to me in OOP. The ability to create a new class, a 'child', from an existing 'parent' class, while inheriting its attributes and methods, was a game-changer. It allowed for code to be reused and extended, reducing redundancy.</p>

            <p>Overall, learning Python's OOP has been a transformative experience. It has not only equipped me with a powerful tool for problem-solving but also changed how I think about code organization and reusability. As I continue my coding journey, I look forward to exploring more advanced OOP concepts and applying them in my projects.</p>

            <p>In this code, colour is an unprotected variable, and _registration_number is a protected variable. The same applies to the methods get_color and _get_registration_number. Even though _registration_number and _get_registration_number can be accessed, the underscore prefix is a hint to the programmer that they should not be accessed directly. </p>
