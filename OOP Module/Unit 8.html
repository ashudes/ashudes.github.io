            <h1>Unit 8: Data Structures and Data Search in Practice</h1>
            <p>This unit focuses on experimenting with operations that can be applied to data structures and understanding how data search algorithms are implemented. The unit explores operations on sets such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference, and introduces the linear data search technique.</p>
            
            <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
            <p>By the end of this unit, you will be able to describe the scenarios where each of the set operations can be applied in the context of a driverless car scenario and implement a linear data search technique.</p>
            
            <h2>Practical Work</h2>
            <p>The practical work in this unit will help students implement the key features required for their summative code assessment, which includes data structures and data search algorithms.</p>

<h1>Key lessons from Unit 8</h1>
<p>Data structures were partly covered in Unit 7, but the practical aspects were covered in Unit 8. I do recall we covered data structures in the previous module as well. Here is a summary from my readings on how data structures play a crucial role in supporting Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Organizing Data:</strong> Data structures provide a way to organize data in an efficient and meaningful manner. They define the relationship between different pieces of data and specify ways of accessing, storing, and organizing the data (Goodrich et al, 2013).</li>
<li><strong>Supporting OOP Principles:</strong> Data structures can be used to implement key OOP principles. For instance, a class (a fundamental concept in OOP) can be seen as a data structure that holds data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on the data (Goodrich et al, 2013).</li>
<li><strong>Enhancing Code Efficiency and Flexibility:</strong> Efficient use of data structures can lead to more efficient and flexible code. For example, using an appropriate data structure like a hash table can significantly speed up data retrieval operations (Goodrich et al, 2013).</li>
<li><strong>Implementing Real-World Entities:</strong> In OOP, real-world entities are represented as objects. These objects are instances of classes, which can be thought of as user-defined data structures. These classes encapsulate data and the methods that operate on them(Goodrich et al, 2013).</li>
<li><strong>Supporting Abstraction and Encapsulation:</strong> Data structures in OOP (like classes) support the principle of abstraction (showing only necessary details) and encapsulation (binding data and functions together), making it easier to manage complexity (Goodrich et al, 2013).</li>
</ol>

            <p>In this code, colour is an unprotected variable, and _registration_number is a protected variable. The same applies to the methods get_color and _get_registration_number. Even though _registration_number and _get_registration_number can be accessed, the underscore prefix is a hint to the programmer that they should not be accessed directly. </p>
