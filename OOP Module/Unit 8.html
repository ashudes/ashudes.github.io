            <h1>Unit 8: Data Structures and Data Search in Practice</h1>
            <p>This unit focuses on experimenting with operations that can be applied to data structures and understanding how data search algorithms are implemented. The unit explores operations on sets such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference, and introduces the linear data search technique.</p>
            
            <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
            <p>By the end of this unit, you will be able to describe the scenarios where each of the set operations can be applied in the context of a driverless car scenario and implement a linear data search technique.</p>
            
            <h2>Practical Work</h2>
            <p>The practical work in this unit will help students implement the key features required for their summative code assessment, which includes data structures and data search algorithms.</p>

            <p>The introduction to Python programming and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) has been an eye-opener for me, especially considering that my background is in a non-computer science field. I've realized how OOP has fundamentally changed my approach to coding.</p>

            <p>In this unit, I learned the basics of object-oriented programming, its major features, abstract classes, applying inheritance, using encapsulation, and polymorphism. Initially, the concept of classes and objects was a bit abstract and challenging to grasp. To augment my understanding, I had to take additional Python courses online. As I delved deeper into the subject, I began to understand the power and flexibility that OOP offers.</p>

            <p>One of the first concepts I learned was the idea of a 'class' - a blueprint for creating objects. I found it fascinating how classes allowed for encapsulation, where data and methods could be bundled together. This not only made the code more organized but also enhanced its reusability. Since I was using a lot of online resources, the interchangeable use of terms such as properties, attributes, and fields was initially confusing. Similarly, methods, functions, and operations were interchangeably used in my readings. I managed to get more clarity through further readings.</p>

            <p>Inheritance was another concept that stood out to me in OOP. The ability to create a new class, a 'child', from an existing 'parent' class, while inheriting its attributes and methods, was a game-changer. It allowed for code to be reused and extended, reducing redundancy.</p>

            <p>Overall, learning Python's OOP has been a transformative experience. It has not only equipped me with a powerful tool for problem-solving but also changed how I think about code organization and reusability. As I continue my coding journey, I look forward to exploring more advanced OOP concepts and applying them in my projects.</p>

            <p>In this code, colour is an unprotected variable, and _registration_number is a protected variable. The same applies to the methods get_color and _get_registration_number. Even though _registration_number and _get_registration_number can be accessed, the underscore prefix is a hint to the programmer that they should not be accessed directly. </p>
