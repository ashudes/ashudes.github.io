<h2>Unit 10: Testing Code in Practice</h2>
<p> In this Unit we examined the approaches to packaging Python code so that it is presented in a user-friendly manner for stakeholders. Prior to releasing code to stakeholders, we must ensure that it meets the client’s needs and that it has been fully tested. We will therefore also examine several approaches to test both the logic and syntax of the code created.</p>
<h2>In this unit we shall:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Apply unit tests to test the functionality of Python code.</li>
    <li>Use the pylint testing tool to automatically check acceptability of the style used to write the Python code.</li>
    <li>Experiment with approaches to commenting inline and documenting code.</li>
</ul>
<h2>On completion of this unit we are expected to be able to:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Write unit tests to ensure correct functionality of Python code.</li>
    <li>Run pylint against a Python script to demonstrate stylistic correctness.</li>
    <li>Document code for release to stakeholders.</li>
</ul>
<p>After developing Python code, this week’s content supports students in testing their code for functional correctness, in addition to accurate stylistic convention. This will be important for the code submitted as part of the summative assessment in Week 11.</p>

            <p>The introduction to Python programming and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) has been an eye-opener for me, especially considering that my background is in a non-computer science field. I've realized how OOP has fundamentally changed my approach to coding.</p>

            <p>In this unit, I learned the basics of object-oriented programming, its major features, abstract classes, applying inheritance, using encapsulation, and polymorphism. Initially, the concept of classes and objects was a bit abstract and challenging to grasp. To augment my understanding, I had to take additional Python courses online. As I delved deeper into the subject, I began to understand the power and flexibility that OOP offers.</p>

            <p>One of the first concepts I learned was the idea of a 'class' - a blueprint for creating objects. I found it fascinating how classes allowed for encapsulation, where data and methods could be bundled together. This not only made the code more organized but also enhanced its reusability. Since I was using a lot of online resources, the interchangeable use of terms such as properties, attributes, and fields was initially confusing. Similarly, methods, functions, and operations were interchangeably used in my readings. I managed to get more clarity through further readings.</p>

            <p>Inheritance was another concept that stood out to me in OOP. The ability to create a new class, a 'child', from an existing 'parent' class, while inheriting its attributes and methods, was a game-changer. It allowed for code to be reused and extended, reducing redundancy.</p>

            <p>Overall, learning Python's OOP has been a transformative experience. It has not only equipped me with a powerful tool for problem-solving but also changed how I think about code organization and reusability. As I continue my coding journey, I look forward to exploring more advanced OOP concepts and applying them in my projects.</p>

            <p>In this code, colour is an unprotected variable, and _registration_number is a protected variable. The same applies to the methods get_color and _get_registration_number. Even though _registration_number and _get_registration_number can be accessed, the underscore prefix is a hint to the programmer that they should not be accessed directly. </p>
