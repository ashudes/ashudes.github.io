            <summary><h1>Unit 2: Object Oriented Analysis - initial steps towards programming in Python </h1></summary>
            <p>In this unit, we made some initial steps towards developing Python programs, after analysing the program domain using a use case diagram and a state machine diagram.</p>

        <h2>The following activities are covered:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Explore the ways in which actors interact with software in terms of the functional requirements of a piece of software.</li>
                <li>Identify the interactions and behaviours invoked within software once active using a state machine diagram.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Expectations from this unit is to:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Design a use case diagram for a software development scenario.</li>
                <li>Create a state machine diagram to examine the behaviours and interactions within a system.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Practical work this week will support further understanding of how to extend the development of a Python program by appreciating the retention of data as variables, and the assignment of variables across difference instances of a class. This will be core to supporting the development required for the coding contribution of the summative assessment. Exploration of the use of the Unified Modelling Language will also be critical to supporting preparation of the design document for the Week 6 summative assessment.</p>

            <p>The introduction to Python programming and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) has been an eye-opener for me, especially considering that my background is in a non-computer science field. I've realized how OOP has fundamentally changed my approach to coding.</p>

            <p>In this unit, I learned the basics of object-oriented programming, its major features, abstract classes, applying inheritance, using encapsulation, and polymorphism. Initially, the concept of classes and objects was a bit abstract and challenging to grasp. To augment my understanding, I had to take additional Python courses online. As I delved deeper into the subject, I began to understand the power and flexibility that OOP offers.</p>

            <p>One of the first concepts I learned was the idea of a 'class' - a blueprint for creating objects. I found it fascinating how classes allowed for encapsulation, where data and methods could be bundled together. This not only made the code more organized but also enhanced its reusability. Since I was using a lot of online resources, the interchangeable use of terms such as properties, attributes, and fields was initially confusing. Similarly, methods, functions, and operations were interchangeably used in my readings. I managed to get more clarity through further readings.</p>

            <p>Inheritance was another concept that stood out to me in OOP. The ability to create a new class, a 'child', from an existing 'parent' class, while inheriting its attributes and methods, was a game-changer. It allowed for code to be reused and extended, reducing redundancy.</p>

            <p>Overall, learning Python's OOP has been a transformative experience. It has not only equipped me with a powerful tool for problem-solving but also changed how I think about code organization and reusability. As I continue my coding journey, I look forward to exploring more advanced OOP concepts and applying them in my projects.</p>
