            <summary><h1>Unit 2: Object Oriented Analysis - initial steps towards programming in Python </h1></summary>
            <p>In this unit, we made some initial steps towards developing Python programs, after analysing the program domain using a use case diagram and a state machine diagram.</p>

        <h2>The following activities are covered:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Explore the ways in which actors interact with software in terms of the functional requirements of a piece of software.</li>
                <li>Identify the interactions and behaviours invoked within software once active using a state machine diagram.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Expectations from this unit is to:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Design a use case diagram for a software development scenario.</li>
                <li>Create a state machine diagram to examine the behaviours and interactions within a system.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Practical work this week will support further understanding of how to extend the development of a Python program by appreciating the retention of data as variables, and the assignment of variables across difference instances of a class. This will be core to supporting the development required for the coding contribution of the summative assessment. Exploration of the use of the Unified Modelling Language will also be critical to supporting preparation of the design document for the Week 6 summative assessment.</p>

           <h1>Key lessons in Unit 2</h1>
                <p>Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA) is typically conducted in an iterative and incremental way. The outputs of OOA activities are analysis models. The intention is for these to be continuously refined and evolved, driven by key factors like risks and business value1.</p>
                <p>While there isn’t a single hard and fast methodology for conducting OOA, there are several well-established approaches and practices. These include:</p>
                <h2>Problem Domain Understanding</h2>
                <p>During OOA, the software engineer works closely with domain experts and stakeholders to understand the problem that the software is intended to solve. This involves gathering requirements, identifying stakeholder’s needs, and understanding the business processes.</p>
                <h2>Use Case Modeling</h2>
                <p>Use cases are used to define the interactions between various actors (people, other systems, etc.) and the system. OOA uses use cases to help developers understand the requirements of a system and to design software systems that meet those requirements.</p>
                <h2>Unified Modeling Language (UML)</h2>
                <p>UML is a standardized notation for creating diagrams that represent different aspects of a software system. OOA uses UML diagrams to represent the different components and interactions of a software system.</p>
                <h2>Design Patterns</h2>
                <p>Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. OOA uses design patterns to help developers create more maintainable and efficient software systems.</p>
