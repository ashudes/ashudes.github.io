            <summary><h1>Unit 11: Pointers, References  Memory and Design Patterns</h1></summary>
    
<p>In Week 11 we continued to appreciate the features in Python around the efficiencies of programming and the lack of a need to use pointers to manage the organisation of memory. This is compared against the overhead of explicit memory management in other programming languages such as C. We explored the use of design patterns to organise code in an object oriented, making comparisons between the creational, structural and behavioural variants. Finally, we examined the concept of sustainable code development, and the way in which this is facilitated using an object oriented programming language such as Python.</p>

<h2>Expected outcome:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Gain an appreciation of the fact that Python does not use pointers, while other programming languages, such as C, do.</li>
    <li>Understand that the way in which code is design can contribute a carbon footprint and consider the design and development of code to minimise this footprint.</li>
    <li>Recognise that code may be organised in a variety of manners dependent on the way in which components will interact with one another.</li>
</ul>

<h2>On completion of this unit we will be able to:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the overhead incurred in some programming languages other than Java as a result of their use of pointers.</li>
    <li>Discuss the reasons why Python is a more sustainable programming language than others.</li>
    <li>Experiment with the design of code using a variety of design patterns.</li>
</ul>

<p>The content this week will support us in understanding how to organise code modules into an architectural form through the application of design patterns. The module also concludes the module by considering a by-product of writing efficient object oriented code, through its ability to support achievement of sustainable, and maintainable, design.</p>        </details>

            <summary><h2>Reflections</h2></summary>
            <p>The introduction to Python programming and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) has been an eye-opener for me, especially considering that my background is in a non-computer science field. I've realized how OOP has fundamentally changed my approach to coding.</p>

            <p>In this unit, I learned the basics of object-oriented programming, its major features, abstract classes, applying inheritance, using encapsulation, and polymorphism. Initially, the concept of classes and objects was a bit abstract and challenging to grasp. To augment my understanding, I had to take additional Python courses online. As I delved deeper into the subject, I began to understand the power and flexibility that OOP offers.</p>

            <p>One of the first concepts I learned was the idea of a 'class' - a blueprint for creating objects. I found it fascinating how classes allowed for encapsulation, where data and methods could be bundled together. This not only made the code more organized but also enhanced its reusability. Since I was using a lot of online resources, the interchangeable use of terms such as properties, attributes, and fields was initially confusing. Similarly, methods, functions, and operations were interchangeably used in my readings. I managed to get more clarity through further readings.</p>

            <p>Inheritance was another concept that stood out to me in OOP. The ability to create a new class, a 'child', from an existing 'parent' class, while inheriting its attributes and methods, was a game-changer. It allowed for code to be reused and extended, reducing redundancy.</p>

            <p>Overall, learning Python's OOP has been a transformative experience. It has not only equipped me with a powerful tool for problem-solving but also changed how I think about code organization and reusability. As I continue my coding journey, I look forward to exploring more advanced OOP concepts and applying them in my projects.</p>

            <p>In this code, colour is an unprotected variable, and _registration_number is a protected variable. The same applies to the methods get_color and _get_registration_number. Even though _registration_number and _get_registration_number can be accessed, the underscore prefix is a hint to the programmer that they should not be accessed directly. </p>
