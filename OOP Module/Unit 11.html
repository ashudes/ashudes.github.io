            <summary><h1>Unit 11: Pointers, References  Memory and Design Patterns</h1></summary>
    
<p>In Week 11 we continued to appreciate the features in Python around the efficiencies of programming and the lack of a need to use pointers to manage the organisation of memory. This is compared against the overhead of explicit memory management in other programming languages such as C. We explored the use of design patterns to organise code in an object oriented, making comparisons between the creational, structural and behavioural variants. Finally, we examined the concept of sustainable code development, and the way in which this is facilitated using an object oriented programming language such as Python.</p>

<h2>Expected outcome:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Gain an appreciation of the fact that Python does not use pointers, while other programming languages, such as C, do.</li>
    <li>Understand that the way in which code is design can contribute a carbon footprint and consider the design and development of code to minimise this footprint.</li>
    <li>Recognise that code may be organised in a variety of manners dependent on the way in which components will interact with one another.</li>
</ul>

<h2>On completion of this unit we will be able to:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the overhead incurred in some programming languages other than Java as a result of their use of pointers.</li>
    <li>Discuss the reasons why Python is a more sustainable programming language than others.</li>
    <li>Experiment with the design of code using a variety of design patterns.</li>
</ul>

<p>The content this week will support us in understanding how to organise code modules into an architectural form through the application of design patterns. The module also concludes the module by considering a by-product of writing efficient object oriented code, through its ability to support achievement of sustainable, and maintainable, design.</p>        </details>

            <summary><h2>Reflections</h2></summary>
<p>In Unit 11 and 12, I dedicated much of my time to finalizing the submission for summative assessment – Implementation of Python OOP for driverless car. As I described earlier, understanding the technology domain of driverless car on its own requires quite a lot of time, let alone application of the concept using python (especially for a beginner like me). Besides, almost all of the online literature sources make references to various libraries that are used with python for developing a driverless car software. Some of these libraries are OpenCV, TensorFlow, TensorFlow hub, numpy, matplotlib, Carla, L5kit, YOLO5/3, and PythonRobotics. I could not ignore the libraries because they seemed to be essential to executing the code. For example, graying the picture colour, applying the Gaussian Blur and Hough-Lines required CV2.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I still faced several frustrations during the coding and testing process of my project.</p>

<ol>
<li>Importing of the libraries which worked well in my Visual Studio Code turned out to be different when transferring to Codio for submission. Either Codio did not support some of them or there were version compatibility issues.</li>
<li>Even in Visual Studio Code –installation of l5kit was not successful; and I could not test the third module (Navigation and Control).</li>
</ol>

<p>Despite the two challenges above I am quite happy with what I have learnt and the experience I gained throughout the coding process.</p>

<p>Overall, learning OOP has been a transformative experience. It has not only equipped me with a powerful tool for problem-solving but also changed how I think about code organization and reusability. As I continue my coding journey, I look forward to exploring more advanced OOP concepts and applying them in my future projects.</p>        </details>
