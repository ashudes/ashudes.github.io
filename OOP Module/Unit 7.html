        <p>This unit covers the topic of debugging and error handling in Python, understanding the types of errors that can occur in a program, and the use of linters to develop high-quality code. The unit also explores data structures for data organization and different search techniques for data processing.</p>
        
        <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
        <p>By the end of this unit, you will be able to apply Python tools to examine code quality, implement data structures for data storage, and implement a search algorithm to explore stored data.</p>
        
        <h2>Practical Work</h2>
        <p>The content of this unit will help students develop high-quality code and organize and process data effectively, which is crucial for the coding contribution of the summative assessment in Week 11.</p>

            <h1>Key lessons from Unit 7 (week 7)</h1>
            <p>In week 7, I spent much time preparing for the summative assessment - a design proposal of software to support operation of driverless car. As I indicated above, the assignment requires a lot of reading to understand the technical domain of a driverless car because of the complexity of the technology. Unfortunately, it left me with less time to organize my understanding from the online searches and to apply the concept using python programming. I will cover more reflection on this under Unit 11.</p>
            
            <p>Apart from the preparation and submission of the summative assessment, debugging, data structures and data search were covered in Unit 7. Debugging or error handling is not a new concept at all for me with a little coding experience that I had in the past. However, learning how Python handles errors did add a lot to my understanding of the concept.</p>
            
            <p>A key concept that I learnt about error handling in Python is how it is done through the use of exceptions that are caught in try blocks and handled in except blocks. Exceptions are errors that have correct syntax but generate an error when running the syntax. A good example here is a division by zero. If an error is encountered, a try block code execution is stopped and transferred down to the except block. In addition to using an except block after the try block, you can also use the finally block. The code in the finally block will be executed regardless of whether an exception occurs (Beckles & Dowling, 2012).</p>        </details>

            <p>In this code, colour is an unprotected variable, and _registration_number is a protected variable. The same applies to the methods get_color and _get_registration_number. Even though _registration_number and _get_registration_number can be accessed, the underscore prefix is a hint to the programmer that they should not be accessed directly. </p>
